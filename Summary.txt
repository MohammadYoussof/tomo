SEMUCB-WM1_dvs.nc                                     model.ref in downloaded package; "SEMUCB-WM1_vs.nc" is calculated as Voigt-average of "SEMUCB-WM1_vsh.nc" and "SEMUCB-WM1_vsv.nc".
TX2000_dvs.nc                                         An average model (TNA and SNA for the upper mantle and PREM for the lower mantle.)
