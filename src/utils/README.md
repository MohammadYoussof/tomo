ContourValueForAreaPercentage.cpp
    -- Find the contour value such that the area with value higher
       takes barely more than the given percentage.

       Example: want to know the dvs contour value of lowermost mantle
       such that area with lower dvs takes about 30% of the CMB area,
       then set the percentage to 70%.
